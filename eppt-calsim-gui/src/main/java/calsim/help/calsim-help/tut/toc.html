        Calsim OAS</font></font></center>
<font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2></font></font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; First make sure that Calsim OAS has been installed correctly.
    This involves installing Calsim OAS as per directions in the Readme.txt
    file. If you have done that and it does not work try to check the following.
    <br>1.) You have defined a CALSIM_HOME directory to point to the top of
    the calsim directory and including it.
    <br>2.) You have added the bin directory under calsim_directory to your
    system path
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For purposes of an example a default project has
    been included in a testdata directory under the calsim distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    To select a model run to analyze we will use a sample run present in the
    testdata directory under the calsim distribution.&nbsp; A set of dss files
    should be present in the testdata directory.
