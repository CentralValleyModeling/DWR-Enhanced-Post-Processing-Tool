    When a DTS table is opened, you could either edit a preexisting TS or add new TS.</P>
<P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first column is the operator. A user can select one of +, -, /, * operations. The operation is
    always between the result of the previous rows and the row on which the operation is present. The first column of
    the first row must contain a math operator. Rows in which the first column is empty will be as if the last operator
    in the first column of previous rows is present. The second column let user select an existing TS, once one TS is
    selected, the following columns in that row can not be edited, which makes a sense. The third column let you select
    a dss file, the fourth and fifth columns let you either select or type in a b-part and a c-part.</P>
<P> The menu items in the <B>Edit</B> menu let user add, insert or remove rows. <BR>
