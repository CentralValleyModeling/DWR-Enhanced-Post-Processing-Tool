    statements are true. An example of a conditional value definition is below. (Remember, the vertical bar "|" means

<FONT FACE="TIMES"><P>ConditionIdentifier is an alphanumeric tag that will be used by the program to label which
    condition was being used during that time step. Each conditionalExpression is evaluated in the order they are
    specified, until one evaluates as true. Subsequent statements are skipped. This is just like a Fortran
    if-then-elseif-endif block.</P>
    <P>The conditionalExpressions are equations or inequalities, or a group of these separated by <B>.and.</B>,
        <B>.or.</B>, or <B>.not.</B>. Parentheses are allowed, as are intrinsic functions. The main restriction on
        conditionalExpressions is that it may not contain any current-period decision variables. In lieu of a
        conditionalExpression, you may specify the keyword <B>always</B>. Such a condition will always evaluate true,
        and that case will always be selected unless a prior case evaluated true. </P>
    <P>The conditions are evaluated in the order specified until one evaluates to true. When this happens, the
        userIdentifier will be symbolically equated to the expression is the value assignment. <U>The final condition
            must be specified as <B>always</B> for a default case.</U></P>
    <P>Note that these are not operating constraints or targets. All value assignments are merely definitions of terms
        that will be used later to specify constraints or targets in the goals section.</P>
