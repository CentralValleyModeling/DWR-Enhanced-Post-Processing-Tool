<P>Goal statements are used to specify system operating constraints and targets and are directly translated into LP
    constraints. Goals can be specified as having definitions that might change each time step, just like for value
    definitions. In addition, goals can be specified as &quot;hard&quot; constraints in which the LP constraint
    <I>must</I> be satisfied, or as &quot;soft&quot; constraints in which the LP constraint may be violated subject to
    some penalty.</P>

<P>These goals are expressed in the form of an equation or an inequality. In WRESL, as in other LP simulation languages,
    a right-hand-side (rhs) and a left-hand-side (lhs) of the constraint are specified. Optionally penalties may be
    assigned for violation of the constraint. Develop your expressions so that they make sense using the lhs/rhs
    concept: outflow = inflow; delivery &lt;= demand; inflow - release = change in storage.</P>

<P>The words &quot;lhs&quot; and &quot;rhs&quot; are for convenience only and are different from the theoretical LP
    meaning of the terms. Decision variable terms and constant terms may both appear on either the left or right side of
    WRESL expressions.</P>

<P>The goal statement allows for a long and short form.</P>
