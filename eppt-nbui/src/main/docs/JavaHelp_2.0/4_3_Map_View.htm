<h2>4.3. Map View</h2>
<p>The Map View Dashboard allows users to view the CalLite study results
    by clicking on the arcs, nodes, and reservoirs in the CalLite schematic.
    Users can choose to view results from the standard schematic or from the
    mass balance schematic. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><i><b>Note:</b></i></span> <span
        style="font-style: italic;"><i>Data for the San Joaquin schematic will
 not be available unless the selected scenario was run with Dynamic SJR 
 simulation turned on.</i></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The mass balance schematic aggregates schematic arcs into larger categories.
    These categories, represented by the red arrows, account for the major
    inflows, outflows, exports and net consumption within the Delta. Alongside
    the major flows are selectable elements for salinity stations (represented
    by yellow circles) and flow objectives (represented by blue circles).
    Clicking on the Salinity Station will display the salinity at that station
    along with its respective salinity standard. Similarly, selecting the
    blue circles will display the flow at that location with its respective
    flow objective.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Controls</p>
<p>To zoom in, hold the ctrl key and draw a box over the area to be enlarged.
    An alternative way to zoom in and out is to hold down shift key and right
    click simultaneously and then move the mouse up and down. To pan across
    the schematic, hold down the shift key and click/drag anywhere in the
    window. Click on ‘Controls’ at any time to load a CalLite study, or change
    the format of the data output. </p>
