<h3>3.5.1. Quick Select </h3>
<p>The Quick Select box at the top of the dashboard gives users the option
    to select a “standard” run for one of the following regulatory environments:
    D-1485, D-1641, and D-1641 plus BO RPAs. Choosing one of these Quick Select
    options with automatically enable all the default regulations for that
    regulatory environment.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If a user would like to deviate from one of the standard regulatory
    environments, the User Defined Quick Select option must be selected. The
    GUI will store the set of options enabled prior to the selection of User
    Defined Quick Select. For example, if a user selects D-1641 Quick Select
    and then chooses User Defined Quick Select, the editable options will
    represent D-1641 regulations (i.e. X2, Roe Trigger, Export-Inflow, and
    Vernalis will be checked ON, while Salinity Standards at Antioch and Chipps
    will be checked OFF).</p>

    when setting user-defined standards. This feature is for advanced model
    users, since user-specified values may cause non-feasible operations,
    even if the model appears to complete successfully. Please check with
    modeling/operations experts to ensure that criteria for these inputs and
    resulting outputs remain reasonable.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Appendix C of the CalLite Reference Manual has a detailed description
    of all of the regulations on this dashboard.</p>
