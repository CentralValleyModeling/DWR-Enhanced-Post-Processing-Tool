<h3>3.5.3. Biological Opinion RPAs Panel</h3>
<p>The standards listed on this panel implement Reasonable and Prudent
    Alternatives (RPAs) as described in the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)
    and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) biological opinions released
    in December 2008 and June 2009, respectively. See Appendix C in the CalLite
    Reference Manual for more detailed descriptions of these RPAs. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The RPAs on this panel are:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>Old and 
 Middle River (FWS RPA Actions 1-3) -</b></span> This limits CVP and SWP exports
    so that flow in the Old and Middle River is no more negative than a specified
    standard during Dec-June. Depending on the time of year, along with the
    hydrologic and biological conditions, this standard can vary from -1,250
    to -5,000 cfs.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img alt="" border="0" class="hcp4" height="24" src="image12.gif" width="25"/><span class="hcp5"><font
        color="red"><b>
 &#160;WARNING:</b></font></span> Deactivate if Old and Middle River regulation is
    selected on the Others panel and the corresponding user-defined radio
    button option is selected on that panel. </p>
<p class="hcp3">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>Fall X2 
 (FWS RPA Action 4) -</b></span> This sets X2 standards for Sept-Nov, which
    are applied in wet and above normal water years. Since this RPA is active
    in different months than the D-1641 X2 standard, both can be applied in
    the same scenario. </p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img alt="" border="0" class="hcp4" height="24" src="image12.gif" width="25"/> <span class="hcp5"><font
        color="red"><b>WARNING:</b></font></span>
    Deactivate if D-14641 X2 regulation is selected on the D-1641/D-1485 panel
    and the corresponding user-defined radio button option is selected on
    that panel.</p>
<p class="hcp3">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>Clear Creek 
 (NMFS RPA Action 1.1.1) -</b></span> This sets minimum flow standards in Clear
    Creek.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1">Delta Cross Channel (NMFS RPA Action 4.1.2)
    - This defines the number of days the DCC gates are open in each month.
    DCC operations under this RPA are set so that the gates are never open
    for longer than required under the D-1641 DCC standard, and in some months
    the RPA may result in even fewer days open. Since this RPA was crafted
    as extra protection above and beyond the D-1641 standard, it will operate
    independently of the D-1641 DCC standard.</p>

                                                             width="25"/> &#160;WARNING:</b></font></span>
    Deactivate if D-14641 Delta Cross Channel regulation is selected on the
    D-1641/D-1485 panel and the corresponding user-defined radio button option
    is selected on that panel.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>San Joaquin 
 River Inflow to Export Ratio (NMFS RPA Action 4.2.1) -</b></span> This limits
    combined exports from the CVP and SWP to a fraction of the flow observed
    along the San Joaquin River at Vernalis.</p>
