<h3>3.5.4. SJR Controls Panel</h3>
<p>The controls on this tab relate to operation of the dynamic San Joaquin
    module of CalLite. &#160;Checking the top checkbox will activate this
    module. &#160;If this checkbox is not checked, the flows on the San Joaquin
    at Vernalis (where it enters the Delta) will be represented as a fixed
    timeseries, and the other checkboxes will have no effect. &#160;The dynamic
    San Joaquin module allows for adjustment of certain regulations that apply
    to the San Joaquin basin, in particular to New Melones Reservoir on the
    Stanislaus River. &#160;Activating the appropriate checkbox will activate
    each of the regulations.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Note that regulations in the San Joaquin basin are currently under review.
    &#160;The two pulse period regulations listed below (VAMP and the 60-day
    pulse flow RPA) are not implemented in current operations in the San Joaquin
    basin, but are options in the model because new pulse period flow requirements
    have not been clearly defined. &#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The regulations on this tab are as follows:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>Vernalis 
 D-1641 baseflows-</b></span> This activates the D-1641 flow requirements at
    Vernalis during February to June (excluding the April 15 - May 15 pulse
    period). &#160;These requirements vary by water year type and whether
    X2 is located east or west of Chipps. &#160;Any additional water needed
    to meet these requirements above the flows required for other regulations
    is released from New Melones Reservoir, with a cap on releases in dry
    conditions.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>Vernalis 
 D-1641 salinity criteria-</b></span> This activates the D-1641 salinity requirements
    at Vernalis, which are 0.7 Electrical Conductivity (EC) during April-August
    and 1.0 EC during September-March. &#160;Any additional water needed to
    meet these requirements above the flows required for other regulations
    is released from New Melones Reservoir, with a cap on releases in extremely
    dry conditions.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>VAMP pulse 
 flows (Apr 15-May 15)-</b></span> This activates flow requirements at Vernalis
    during the April 15 - May 15 pulse period. &#160;These flow requirements
    vary depending on whether the model is run with Existing or Future Level
    of Development. &#160;For Future Level of Development, the flow requirements
    are based on the Vernalis Adaptive Management Program (VAMP) that was
    implemented from 1999-2011. &#160;Water is released to meet these requirements
    from multiple tributaries on a schedule defined in the San Joaquin River
    Agreement. &#160;For Existing Level of Development the flow requirements
    are based on the agreement between Reclamation and Merced Irrigation District
    which was implemented in 2012-2013. &#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>Vernalis 
 60-day pulse flow RPA (NMFS Action 4.2.1)-</b></span> This activates a 60-day
    pulse flow requirement at Vernalis during April and May, which varies
    by water year type. &#160;This requirement is in the NMFS Biological Opinion
    released in June 2009. &#160;Any additional water needed to meet this
    requirement above the flows required for other regulations is released
    from New Melones Reservoir, with a cap on releases in dry conditions.</p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>Stanislaus 
 flow RPA (NMFS Action 3.1.3)-</b></span> This activates a fish flow requirement
    on the Stanislaus River which varies by water year type. &#160;This requirement
    is from the NMFS Biological Opinion released in June 2009. &#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>San Joaquin 
 River Restoration flows-</b></span> This toggles the San Joaquin River Restoration
    flows between interim flows and full flows. &#160;Flow requirements vary
    by water year type. &#160;These flows are released from Friant Dam on
    the upper San Joaquin River, and are defined under the 2006 Settlement
    that led to the San Joaquin River Restoration Program. &#160;Interim flows
    are designed to allow for collection of data and research prior to implementation
    of full Restoration flows.</p>
