<h2>4.2. Custom Results</h2>
<p>The Custom Results Dashboard allows the user to filter and retrieve
    variables directly from the DV or SV file, including variables that cannot
    be selected through Quick Results or Map View. The filtered variables
    can be displayed in the same format as those brought up from Quick Results
    (i.e. Exceedance Plots, tables). This feature combines the broad range
    of post-processing features from Quick Results with the ability to bring
    up and analyze any variable in the DSS files. The user can view the data
    for these variables directly, or they may elect to create derived time-series
    (DTS) from them. DTS are created by combining two or more time-series
    with basic mathematical operators and may be custom-tailored to fit the
    needs of a specific project or investigation. These DTS can be saved and
    accessed at a later session.</p>
