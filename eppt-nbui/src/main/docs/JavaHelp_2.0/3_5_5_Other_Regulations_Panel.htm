<h3>3.5.5 Other Regulations Panel</h3>
<p>This panel allows the user to activate three additional regulations
    and define values for them in the table on the right side of the screen.
    The month numbers in the user-defined tables refer to water year months
    (i.e. Oct=1, Nov=2, etc.)</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The regulations available on the Other Regulations Panel are:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>QWEST (San 
 Joaquin River near Jersey Point).</b></span> This is a minimum flow standard
    on the San Joaquin River near Jersey Point. The user can define values
    for this standard by month and water year type.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>Old and 
 Middle River.</b></span> This limits CVP and SWP exports so that flow in the
    Old and Middle River (OMR) is no more negative than a specified standard
    during Dec-June. Standards can be specified by month and water year type.
</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img alt="" border="0" class="hcp4" height="24" src="image14.gif" width="25"/><span class="hcp5"><font
        color="red"><b>
 WARNING:</b></font></span> When the user-defined radio button is selected, the RPA
    OMR (on the Biological Opinion RPAs panel) standard should be disabled.
</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>San Joaquin 
 River Inflow to Export ratio with offset.</b></span> This limits combined
    CVP and SWP exports to a cap computed based on San Joaquin River flow
    at Vernalis. The cap is computed as: offset+(multiplier×Vernalis). The
    offset and multiplier values can be specified by month and water year
    type. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img alt="" border="0" class="hcp4" height="24" src="image14.gif" width="25"/> <span class="hcp5"><font
        color="red"><b>WARNING:</b></font></span>
    When the user-defined radio button is selected, the RPA SJR Inflow to
    Export Ratio (on the Biological Opinion RPAs panel) standard should be
    disabled. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>B2 Actions.</b></span>
    These buttons implement actions from the Central Valley Project Improvement
    Act (CVPIA) Section 3406(b)(2) program (referred to as “B2”) to dedicate
    up to 800,000 acre-feet of CVP yield annually for fish and wildlife protection
    and habitat restoration. From the initial implementation of the B2 program,
    up to seven actions were modeled by CalLite. Recently introduced regulations
    have made Actions 2, 6 and 7 redundant. Consequently, these actions are
    no longer modeled and are not available as GUI selections. The available
    actions are:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp6">Action 1: &#160;Upstream
    Minimum Flow Requirements</p>
<p class="hcp6">Action 3: &#160;VAMP
    Export Reduction (April 15 – May15)</p>
<p class="hcp6">Action 4: &#160;CVP
    VAMP Export Extension (May 16 – 31)</p>
<p class="hcp6">Action 5: &#160;CVP
    Export Ramping (June 1 – 30)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 4.5pt;">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>Fraction 
 of Unimpaired Flow for Delta Criteria.</b></span> In July 2010, the State
    Water Resources Control Board issued a report on Delta flow criteria.
    The user can activate those criteria in the model (for Delta outflow,
    the Sacramento River, and the San Joaquin River) and also specify different
    criteria if desired. Note that unlike all of the other regulations on
    this dashboard, when this option is activated, this is a post-processing
    option, NOT a regulation. CalLite does not force flows at these locations
    to meet these criteria. It only compares flows to the criteria and computes
    how much additional water would be needed to meet the criteria.</p>
