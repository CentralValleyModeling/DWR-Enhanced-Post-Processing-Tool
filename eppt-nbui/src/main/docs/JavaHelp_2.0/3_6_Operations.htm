<h2>3.6. Operations</h2>
<p>The operations dashboard has options relating to CVP and SWP system
    operations, as follows:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span class="hcp1"><b>CVP Operations and Facilities.</b></span>
    The checkboxes here can be used to turn on or off three different wheeling
    operations: Payback Wheeling (D-1485), CVC Wheeling, and Joint Point of
    Diversion. The option is also available to turn on or off the Delta- Mendota
    Canal (DMC)/California Aqueduct Intertie. The Intertie project allows
    the DMC and California Aqueduct to share conveyance capacity, thus increasing
    export capacity. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For more detailed description of these operational facilities, see the
    Reference Manual. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span class="hcp1"><b>CVP/SWP Allocation Methods.</b></span>
    Here the user can choose between different CVP and SWP allocation methods.
    Currently, users have the option for allocation by either Water Supply
    Index/Delivery Index (WSI/DI) curves or by the Forecast Allocation Method
    (FAM). </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">WSI-DI Method</p>
<p class="hcp3">The WSI-DI method is the procedure currently
    used in CalSim II. This logic develops an allocation decision for system-wide
    CVP and SWP deliveries based on water in storage, forecasts of usable
    inflow, and storage carryover targets. The allocations for the CVP Water
    Right, Exchange, and Settlement contractors and SWP Feather River Service
    Area contractors are dependent on reservoir inflow criteria. South-of-Delta
    delivery allocations for the CVP are based on water in CVP San Luis storage
    plus projections of available water for export prior to low point. This
    is identical to the current procedure used in CalSim II. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp3">Default WSI/DI curves for both CVP and SWP
    may be altered by clicking on the appropriate box and editing the values
    in the table on the right side of the screen. The user should be aware
    that the WSI-DI curves should be edited with caution. They are carefully
    developed through iterative simulation of CalSim II, with a particular
    set of water supplies and demands. More aggressive allocations may result
    in reservoir storage conditions that are not able to meet regulations
    through dry years. Relaxed allocations may result in storage levels that
    create higher flows in some months and unexpected modifications to Delta
    operations. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>

        color="red"><b>WARNING:</b></font></span>
    Model results may differ from expected operation, so a careful analysis
    of the output results by an expert is always necessary. </p>
<p class="hcp3">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">FAM Method</p>
<p class="hcp3">FAM is developed based on the California
    Allocation Module (CAM). The model is developed by utilizing the multi-step
    optimization functions in WRIMS 2. FAM is coupled with the CalLite model
    by working as an additional cycle.</p>
<p class="hcp3">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">For more information about CalLite allocation
    methods, see Appendix G of the CalLite Reference Manual.</p>
