<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The CalLite 3.00 User's Guide facilitates easy use of the CalLite GUI
    by describing all of the screens, dashboards, panels, and options available
    on the GUI. For information on aspects of the model other than the graphical
    user interface (GUI), see the CalLite 3.00 Reference Manual, which is
    distributed as a separate PDF.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>1.1. &#160;The CalLite 3.00 Model&#160;&#160;</h2>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>CalLite is an interactive screening model for management of California’s
    water systems. It simulates the hydrology of the Central Valley, reservoir
    operations and delivery allocation decisions for the State Water Project
    (SWP) and Central Valley Project (CVP), delta salinity responses to river
    flow and export changes, and habitat-ecosystem indices. CalLite contains
    much of the same functionality as the more detailed CalSim II model, but
    is simplified in its spatial and hydrologic detail. The power of a screening
    model such as CalLite is the ability to rapidly simulate system operations
    and to incorporate changes with relative ease. The current version of
    CalLite simulates system operations on a monthly basis for the full 82-year
    period of record (water year 1922-2003) in approximately 5 minutes (in
    comparison to 30 minutes in CalSim) on an up-to-date modeling computer,
    and can be run with a variety of different options in terms of hydroclimate,
    demands, facilities and infrastructure, regulations, and system operations.
    Despite the simplifications included in CalLite, the model results corroborate
    with a comparable CalSim II study.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>CalLite 3.00, the newest version of the CalLite model, is implemented
    using an updated simulation engine developed from the Water Resource Integrated
    Modeling System 2 (WRIMS 2). Moving to a WRIMS 2 engine allowed the easy
    implementation of new CalLite features in an efficient way and maintains
    CalLite’s corroboration with CalSim (now also run in WRIMS 2). </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Further information on the CalLite 3.00 model can be found in this User's
    Guide, in the CalLite 3.00 Reference Manual, and at the <a
            href="http://baydeltaoffice.water.ca.gov/modeling/hydrology/CalLite/index.cfm">CalLite&#160;website</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A CalLite tutorial is available at the end of this User's Guide.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>1.2. &#160;Installation</h2>
<p>The CalLite model is currently delivered in a single installer file.
    Installation consists of extracting all files in the archive (.zip) to
    a file system location on a Windows XP, Vista, or Windows 7 computer.
    During installation, a CalLite3.00.exe icon is generated on the desktop.
    The software is started by double-clicking the icon. Alternatively, users
    may start the CalLite GUI from start&gt;program&gt;CalLite3.00&gt;CalLite3.00.
    Users may also start the CalLite GUI by double-clicking on the file “CalLiteGUI.exe”
    in the root directory of the extracted version (see Figure 1-1 below).</p>
