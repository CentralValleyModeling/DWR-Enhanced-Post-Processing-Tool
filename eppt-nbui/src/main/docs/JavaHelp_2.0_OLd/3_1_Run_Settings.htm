<h2>3.1. Run Settings</h2>
<p>The Run Settings dashboard allows the user to load, save, run, select
    scenario(s), view scenario settings, enter a scenario description, initiate
    batch runs, specify the run period, run type, and specify the run basis.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Scenario settings are saved with a file extension .cls (CalLite Scenario).
    The file is portable and can be easily loaded by another user.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The <span class="hcp1"><b>View Scenario Settings</b></span> button
    allows the user to view all selected scenario options in a summarized
    table. This should be checked to ensure that all settings are correct
    before running.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Run Period can be set to any period starting no earlier than Oct
    1921 and ending no later than Sep 2003 (water years 1922-2003). In this
    version of CalLite, only deterministic run types are possible. Probabilistic
    runs may be added in later versions of the model. The Run Basis sets the
    type of CalSim II run to use as a baseline of the CalLite run. Currently,
    three run bases are available: Biological Opinion RPAs, Pre-Biological
    Opinion RPAs, and D-1485. The base CalSim II run affects the AD (accretion/depletion)
    terms that are used in CalLite (through the SV input file) and also the
    WSI-DI tables. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If shortages associated with AD terms in the North of Delta area exist,
    CalLite will display a warning message at the end of the simulation. See
    Appendix A of the CalLite Reference Manual for a further description of
    AD terms and shortages.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The <span class="hcp1"><b>Batch Runs</b></span> option provides
    the capability to run up to four CalLite studies simultaneously, which
    is more efficient than having to parameterize and run each individual
    study through a separate GUI instance.</p>
