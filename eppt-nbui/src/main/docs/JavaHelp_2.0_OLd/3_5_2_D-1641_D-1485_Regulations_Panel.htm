<h3>3.5.2. D-1641/D-1485 Regulations Panel</h3>
<p class="hcp1">This panel contains regulations described
    by State Water Resources Control Board Decisions 1641 (D-1641) and 1485
    (D-1485). These regulations are summarized below and in more detail in
    Appendix C of the CalLite Reference Manual. Clicking the checkbox next
    to a regulation will activate it. </p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img alt="" border="0" class="hcp3" height="24" src="image9.gif" width="25"/> &#160;<span
        class="hcp4"><font color="red"><b>WARNING:</b></font></span> D-1485 regulations are no longer
    operationally used in California. The option to run a scenario with D-1485
    regulations is provided simply as a service to users. </p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1">For many of these standards, the specific
    D-1641 or D-1485 standard may be replaced with a user-defined standard.
    If this is desired, after turning on the regulation, click on the radio
    button for user-defined and enter desired values in the editable table
    (on the right half of the screen). The numbered months refer to water
    year months, so Oct = 1, Nov =2, etc.</p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1">The regulations on this panel are as follows:</p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp5">Interior
    Delta Flows:</p>
<p class="hcp2"><span class="hcp6"><b>Delta Cross 
 Channel (DCC) -</b></span> This defines the numbers of days the DCC gates
    are open in each month. Operation of the DCC assists in transferring fresh
    water from the Sacramento River south across the Delta. Operations depend
    on water quality, flood protection, and fish and wildlife requirements.
    The number of days open each month can be adjusted using the user-defined
    option.</p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp7">&#160;<img alt="" border="0" class="hcp3" height="24" src="image10.gif" width="25"/> &#160;<span
        class="hcp4"><font color="red"><b>WARNING:</b></font></span> When the user-defined radio button
    is selected, the Delta Cross Channel RPA (on the Biological Opinion RPAs
    panel) should be disabled. </p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp5">River
    Flows:</p>
<p class="hcp2"><span class="hcp6"><b>Sacramento 
 River at Rio Vista Minimum Flow -</b></span> This defines the minimum flow
    requirement at Rio Vista, which vary by month and water year type. This
    standard can be adjusted using the user-defined option.</p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2"><span class="hcp6"><b>Trinity 
 Minimum Flows -</b></span> This defines the Trinity River minimum flow that
    was in place during the implementation of either the D-1485 or D-1641
    standards. Note that these minimum flows are not considered part of the
    D-1485 or D-1641 regulation and are not defined in either of the regulatory
    documents. </p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">The default for a D-1485 regulatory environment
    is lower minimum flows from the 340 TAF/yr Trinity minimum required flow
    based on the Trinity River Index. The default for a D-1641 regulatory
    environment is higher minimum flows from the 369-815 TAF/yr Trinity minimum
    required flow based on the Trinity River Index.</p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">Users are not able to turn off the Trinity
    minimum flows altogether, so to access the available options (D-1641 or
    D-1485) for this checkbox, right click on the text for <span class="hcp8"><i>Trinity
 Minimum Flows</i></span>. &#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp5">Delta
    Outflows:</p>
<p class="hcp2"><span class="hcp6"><b>Minimum 
 Net Delta Outflow -</b></span> This defines the minimum outflow requirement
    through the Delta. The flow standard varies depending on month, water
    year type, and other criteria as specified in D-1641. </p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2"><span class="hcp6"><b>X2 Requirements 
 -</b></span> The X2 position is the distance (in kilometers) east of the Golden
    Gate Bridge where the salinity level is two ppt (parts per thousand) Chloride.
    The goal of this standard is to maintain the X2 position at or to the
    west of certain specified locations. Under D-1641, this standard is in
    place Feb-June and is enforced in different locations (Roe Island, Chipps
    Island, and Collinsville) for different parts of each month depending
    on certain criteria. </p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">When the user-defined radio button is selected,
    the X2 standard can be turned on or off for each month, values can be
    set in kilometers by month and water year type, and both the Roe Trigger
    and the BO RPA Fall X2 standard should be disabled. </p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp7">&#160;&#160;&#160;<img alt="" border="0" class="hcp3" height="24" src="image11.gif" width="24"/>
    &#160;<span class="hcp4"><font color="red"><b>WARNING:</b></font></span> When the
    user-defined radio button is selected, both the Roe Trigger and the BO
    RPA Fall X2 standard should be disabled. </p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2"><span class="hcp6"><b>Roe Trigger-</b></span>
    This trigger is a D-1641 regulation. Under D-1641 standards, X2 is required
    to be at or west of Roe Island for a certain number of days if the preceding
    month's X2 position was west of Roe. If the preceding month's X2 position
    was east of Roe, then the required number of days is automatically set
    to zero. If the trigger is not activated (checked on), the required number
    days west of Roe is always zero.</p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp7">&#160;&#160;<img alt="" border="0" class="hcp3" height="24" src="image11.gif" width="24"/> &#160;<span
        class="hcp4"><font color="red"><b>WARNING:</b></font></span> Deactivate
    if user-defined radio button option is selected for X2 regulation (on
    the D-1641/D-1485 panel).</p>
<p class="hcp7">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp5">Export
    Restrictions:</p>
<p class="hcp2"><span class="hcp6"><b>Export-Inflow 
 Ratio –</b></span> This D-1641 standard limits the combined exports of CVP
    and SWP to a specific proportion of total Delta outflow. The standard
    varies by month and river flow levels. When the user-defined option is
    selected, this proportion (ratio) can be adjusted by month.</p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2"><span class="hcp6"><b>Vernalis 
 (Vernalis D-1641 Criteria) –</b></span> This standard limits the combined
    exports of CVP and SWP to the minimum of two different standards during
    the Apr 15-May 15 pulse period. The first standard is from D-1641, where
    exports are limited to the maximum of 1,500 cfs or San Joaquin River flow
    at Vernalis. The second standard is the VAMP (Vernalis Adaptive Management
    Plan) export cap, which varies depending on the VAMP pulse flows released
    during this same period. &#160;In certain situations it is possible for
    the user to have the VAMP export cap turned on while the VAMP pulse flows
    are turned off (either when using the dynamic San Joaquin module or when
    using a D-1485 run basis, which has no VAMP pulse flows). &#160;In these
    cases the VAMP export cap will be de-activated, since that cap is based
    on the pulse flow requirement, so cannot be accurately set without it.
    &#160;In these cases the D-1641 export cap will remain active.</p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2"><span class="hcp6"><b>Pumping 
 Limits (Jones and Banks) –</b></span> This limits pumping at Jones and Banks
    pumping plants according to the selected regulation. Under D-1641, Jones
    is limited to 4,600 and Banks is limited to 6,680. Under D-1485, Jones
    and Banks are additionally limited to 3,000 CFS in May and June and Banks
    is additionally limited to 4,600 in July. Users are not able to turn off
    the pumping limits altogether, so to access the available options (D-1641
    or D-1485) for this checkbox, right click on the text for <span class="hcp8"><i>Pumping
 Limits (Jones and Banks)</i></span>. &#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp5">Salinity
    Standards:</p>
<p class="hcp2">CalLite includes the option to include salinity
    standards at: Emmaton and Jersey Point (for agriculture), Rock Slough
    (for Municipal and Industrial), and Collinsville (for fish and wildlife),
    and Antioch and Chipps (D-1485 additional standard locations). These standards
    vary depending on month and water year type. </p>
