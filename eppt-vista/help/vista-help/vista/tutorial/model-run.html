<u><font size=+1>Loading a model run:</font></u>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on the File menu followed by "Open Base" and
then "Dvar File" ( File|OpenBase|Dvar File, I will be using this convention
from now on). This should open a filechooser dialog box. Goto the testdata
directory under the calsim distribution and select a dvar file ( usually
ending in dv.dss ). Let us select sim514dv.dss for now.&nbsp; If selected
the named file should display in the status panel.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To load the svar file click File|Open Base|Svar
File. This should open a file chooser from which you should select sim514sv.dss
file. This completes loading a model run and now we are ready for some
analysis.
