<p>
 Vista is a tool for storage,management and visualization of time
series data. 
</p>
<p>
 Time series data is stored in a time series specific data
base called HEC-DSS ( a href here ). This allows efficient retrieval
and storage of the data. 
</p>
<p>
 Time series data objects are provided for manipulation via scripting
using object-oriented concepts. A time series class provides the basic
interface for manipulating time series data. Math operations are
provided as higher level operations between time series. In addition
time series specific functions such as moving average's etcetra are
also available. More detail provided here...
</p>
<p>
 Visualization of time series is primarily through the use of line
graphs and tables. The graphs are live graphs and can be zoomed and
paged. Printing and saving to gif or jpeg is also available. 
</p>
<p>
 Time manipulation functions are provided as well such as calculating
the number of intervals within a time window. These concepts are
expressed in objects which are explained here...
</p>
<p>
 Vista is written in Java with Fortan/C interface to the HEC-DSS
libraries. This interface is provided by the use of dll or shared
object libraries. Vista also used JPython as a scripting language
which is called vscript. This is essentially jpython with most
commonly used Vista functionality available on startup.
</p>
<p>
Vista is distributed under GPL and the source code is available from
the website of the Delta Modeling Section
http://wwwdelmod.water.ca.gov
The binary distribution of vista is available as a zip file which can
be installed using the installer it is packaged with. Vista works with
Java 1.1 and later versions
