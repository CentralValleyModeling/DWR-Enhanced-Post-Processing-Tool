<br><u><font size=+1>Retrieving data by defining a MTS:</font></u>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiple time series are just groups of data that
one intends to view together. These are very similar to DTS except that
they don't have operations defined between them. Only the table and graph
views are available on them for now.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MTS can be loaded and saved in a similar way as
DTS.
