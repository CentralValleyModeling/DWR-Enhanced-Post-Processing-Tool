<u><font size=+1>Editing the time window:</font></u>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By default the data would be displayed for the full
time window available in the dss file. To change this select Edit|Time
Window. This should open up a dialog with input for the time window string.
The time window must be entered in ddMMMyyyy HHmm - ddMMMyyyy HHmm format,
where the d is the day of the month , M is the character for month, y is
the year, H is the 2400 format time and m is the time of the hour in minutes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, to select OCT 1935 - SEP&nbsp;1965
enter 31OCT1935 2400 - 30SEP1965 2400. This will be improved in the coming
versions but bear with us for now. Also notice the space between the year
and hour and the single dash between the start and end times.
