<h1>Introduction to VPlotter</h1>

    <p>
      VPlotter is one of the tools for working with DSS Files. DSS files
      contain time series data with each time series identified by its
      pathname. The pathname consists of 6 parts named A through F. The
      user definable paths are A,B,C and F.
    </p>
    <p>
      VPlotter attempts to strike a balance between scripting's
      automation and extensibility and a GUI's ability to
      browse. Scripting is great for automation and GUI's are great
      for browsing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vista GUI is designed mainly for browsing a DSS file. However
      once you have browsed a DSS file, you pretty much have an idea
      of what time series you would like to see and how you would like
      to manipulate them. This is where VPlotter shines.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are times however when the existing functionality will not
      suffice. Say you have a time series with some missing data and
      you want to fill in the missing values. This is not easily
      generalized and as such you may have a custom routine to fill in
      the values. This is where scripting allows you to change or
      create a new time series from any information you may have such
      as other time series or text data or generated data. This is
      where scripting shines. 
    </p>
    <p>
      VPlotter attempts to provide some browsing like functionality
      and some scripting ability and works on top of existing
      functionality of the Vista libraries. As such it is able to
      automate common tasks with regular time series and make the
      manipulations repeatable and reliable. Furthermore any scripting
      functions you may write are easily accessible in VPlotter.
